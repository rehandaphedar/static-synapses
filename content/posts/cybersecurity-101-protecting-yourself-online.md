# Cybersecurity 101: Protecting Yourself Online

In today's digital world, cybersecurity is no longer optionalâ€”it's essential. Here are some fundamental tips to protect yourself from online threats: 

**1. Strong Passwords:**

* **Use unique passwords for each account.**
* **Make them long (at least 12 characters) and complex**, combining uppercase/lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
* **Consider a password manager** to securely store and generate passwords.

**2. Be Wary of Phishing Attacks:**

* **Think twice before clicking links or opening attachments** in emails or messages, especially from unknown senders.
* **Hover over links to verify their destination** before clicking.
* **Be suspicious of emails requesting personal information.**

**3. Keep Software Up to Date:**

* **Enable automatic updates for your operating system, apps, and browsers.** 
* **Software updates often include security patches** that address vulnerabilities. 

**4. Secure Your Network:**

* **Use a strong password for your Wi-Fi network.**
* **Consider using a VPN** (Virtual Private Network) when connecting to public Wi-Fi.

**5. Be Mindful of What You Share:**

* **Limit the personal information you share online,** especially on social media.
* **Be cautious about granting apps access to your data.** 

**6. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):**

* **Enable 2FA whenever possible.** It adds an extra layer of security by requiring a code from your phone or email in addition to your password.

**Conclusion:**

By following these basic cybersecurity practices, you can significantly reduce your risk of falling victim to cybercrime and navigate the digital world with greater confidence.
